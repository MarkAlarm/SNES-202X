I may write my own tools for this project; those will be left in the tools folder as they are my own work.
Other tools will not be included, though I will include links to anything that I do use.

If you want to build the ROM, put the below build of asar.exe into this folder.

I used M1TE2 to generate .map files, which can be found here below.
